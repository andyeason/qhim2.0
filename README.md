    androidConfig = [
            minSdk     : 21,
            targetSdk  : 32,

    ]
    //The ID of the module
    applicationId = [
            "app" : "io.openim.android.demo",
            "OUIConversation" :"io.openim.android.ouiconversation",

	//Disabling a module will remove all functionalities associated with that module
       //implementation project(':OUICalling')
    }
```
### Issues :bookmark_tabs:
1. Reminder: If you encounter the "resource loading is not complete" error when calling SDK-related APIs, make sure to call other APIs after the login callback is executed.   
2. After disabling or adding a module, if the app shows an error toast when calling the functionalities of that module, you can resolve the issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the app.  
3. Reminder: Avoid using duplicate names for resources across different modules.  
4. Some ViewModels need to be globally shared. Developers should pay attention to whether ViewModels are cached in viewModels and release them in a timely manner when they are no longer in use to avoid memory leaks.
